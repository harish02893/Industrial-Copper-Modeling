# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

# Project Summary: Industrial Copper Modeling

Skills Acquired:

Python scripting
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Machine Learning (Regression and Classification)
Model Building and Evaluation
Streamlit for building interactive web applications
Domain: Manufacturing

Problem Statement:
The copper industry faces challenges in accurately predicting selling prices and classifying leads. Manual methods for pricing and lead classification can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict selling prices and classify leads efficiently.

Approach:

Data Understanding: Analyze the dataset to identify variable types and distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, treat outliers, and address skewness in the data. Encode categorical variables appropriately.
EDA: Visualize outliers and skewness using seaborn plots. Perform feature engineering and drop highly correlated columns.
Model Building and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train and evaluate regression models for predicting selling prices and classification models for lead classification. Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
Model GUI: Utilize Streamlit to create an interactive web application. Allow users to input data and obtain predictions for selling prices and lead status.
Learning Outcomes:

Proficiency in Python programming and data analysis libraries.
Understanding of data preprocessing techniques and EDA.
Experience in building and optimizing machine learning models.
Skill development in feature engineering and model evaluation.
Ability to create interactive web applications using Streamlit.
Understanding of challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain.
Project Evaluation Metrics:

Modular code structure for maintainability.
Code portability across different environments.
Maintenance of code on GitHub with a public repository.
Inclusion of a proper README file with project workflow and execution details.
Adherence to coding standards outlined in PEP 8.
Creation of a demo video showcasing the working model and posting it on LinkedIn.
This project provides practical experience in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and web application development, offering a solid foundation for addressing real-world challenges in the manufacturing domain.

# Project Submission

## Project Title:
Industrial Copper Modeling

## Skills Acquired:
- Python scripting
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning (Regression and Classification)
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Streamlit for building interactive web applications

## Domain:
Manufacturing

## Problem Statement:
The copper industry faces challenges in accurately predicting selling prices and classifying leads. Manual methods for pricing and lead classification can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict selling prices and classify leads efficiently.

## Approach:
1. **Data Understanding:** Analyzed the dataset to identify variable types and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, treated outliers, and addressed skewness in the data. Encoded categorical variables appropriately.
3. **EDA:** Visualized outliers and skewness using seaborn plots. Performed feature engineering and dropped highly correlated columns.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained and evaluated regression models for predicting selling prices and classification models for lead classification. Optimized model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
5. **Model GUI:** Utilized Streamlit to create an interactive web application. Allowed users to input data and obtain predictions for selling prices and lead status.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Developed proficiency in Python programming and data analysis libraries.
- Gained understanding of data preprocessing techniques and EDA.
- Experienced in building and optimizing machine learning models.
- Developed skills in feature engineering and model evaluation.
- Acquired ability to create interactive web applications using Streamlit.
- Understood challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain.

## Project Evaluation Metrics:
- Maintained modular code structure for maintainability.
- Ensured code portability across different environments.
- Maintained code on GitHub with a public repository.
- Included a proper README file with project workflow and execution details.
- Adhered to coding standards outlined in PEP 8.
- Created a demo video showcasing the working model and posted it on LinkedIn.
